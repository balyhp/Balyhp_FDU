## Introduction
It's really suffering to take undergraduate experiment lessons especially if you have no interest in experimental physics, I've wasted quite a lot precious time on processing shit-like data and being words-tailor to make up a report that I'll never read again after it's submitted.  It's more like a formalism performance.
I think it's unfair for those who want to do theoritical physics work to suffer from this, so I create this repo, it contains complete report papers of the compulsory experiment lessons you will take in FDU physics department, as well as a latex template of report papers.
