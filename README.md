# FDU Physics Experiment All in One
## Introduction
It's really suffering to take undergraduate experiment courses especially if you have no interest in experimental physics, I've wasted quite a lot precious time on processing shit-like data and being words-tailor to make up a report that I'll never read again after it's submitted.  It's more like a formalism performance. All in all, experiment courses has the lowest pay-back rate.
I think it's unfair for those who want to do theoritical physics work to suffer from this, so I create this repo.

It contains complete report papers of the compulsory experiment lessons you will take in FDU physics department, as well as a latex template of report papers.
## How to use
You can download any part you need in .zip format, or clone the whole repo to you own PC as well as share the resources with your classmates. 

As for the template, in the folder you will find `template.cls` `template.tex` and `ref.bib`, make sure they are under the same directory in compiling.
I also provide a FDU theme beamer template (supporting easy references citation for presentation use) in this repository: https://github.com/balyhp/FDU-beamer-template.git
## Enjoy yourself !
